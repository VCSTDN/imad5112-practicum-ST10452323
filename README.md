I was given the task to create my own weather app for Androids

## **Purpose**

The purpose of my application is information as the user can view the weather conditions.

## **Design Conciderations**

Layout- I wanted to make my applications layout fun and imformative but at the same time simple and easy to use.

Target audience- I had to consider the target audience of the application, their ages, their level of computer literacy. In order to make my application suitable for everyone I made it very simple and easy to follow.


## **Utilisation of GitHub and GitHub Actions**

GitHub was extremely useful and beneficial tool in creating my application as it provides a safe and secure location to store my code as I can retrieve it on any device if something were to happen to my local code. It is also benefitable to other users as they can access my code with my permission and track my progress on the application, as well as inform me of any additional information I need to add or remove. They can also inform me of any error or give me advise that can improve my application. It also helped me manage my application better as I could pick up errors in my code faster which saved me valuable time and I was able run my code more regularly as I worked through coding my application which made the coding process much faster and more efficient as well as more pleasant. 

GitHub Actions were useful as I could build, run, and edit my code on the site as it processes the code when I push it to the site, and it picks up any bugs and/or issues in my code. It also helped me turn my ideas into functional, user-friendly code. GitHub Actions also ensures that my code was good quality and would function on different platforms as I was able to work through my code in smaller sections which allowed me to play more attention to what I was doing in more manageable portions. 

## **About the Application**

The application will open onto a simple user-friendly homepage.
